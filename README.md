# Python-Finance-using-Stock-Market
Using Jupyter Notebook, I obtained the S&P 500 stock data and manipulated it so that I get the correlation between each stock.

Correlation describes the size and direction of a relationship between two or more variables. In the chart below using the Yahoo Finance API, I was able to get data on the Open, Closed and Adjusted closed prices for every market day of the year 2022.
This data can help quant analysts in understanding the overall stock market's health
